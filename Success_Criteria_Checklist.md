### Option 1: Configure my device and troubleshoot device configuration issues:
#### Success Criteria
- [ ] I am actively using reference materials to complete my device configuration tasks.
- [ ] I am actively leveraging the support of the device configuration experts in my class to confirm that I am on the right track in completing the configuration tasks below and to help me troubleshoot as needed.
- [ ] I have downloaded Anaconda Navigator to my virtual environment.
- [ ] I have downloaded GitBash to my virtual environment.
- [ ] I have created a new repo on GitHub named `Computer_Science_Portfolio` and it meets all required specifications.
- [ ] I have added Mr. Swotinsky as a collaborator to my `Computer_Science_Portfolio` repo on GitHub.
- [ ] I have cloned my `Computer_Science_Portfolio` repo from GitHub to my virtual environment using the correct path.
- [ ] I have created a `Data_Science_1` subdirectory within the `Computer_Science_Portfolio` repo on my virtual environment.
- [ ] I have added Jupyter Notebook's installation path to my virtual environment's path environment variable.
- [ ] I have created a batch file on the desktop of my virtual environment to launch Jupyter Notebook using the correct path.
- [ ] I have successfully created, saved, added, commited, and pushed a test file from the `Computer Science_Portfolio` repo on my virtual environment to my `Computer_Science_Portfolio` repo on GitHub.



### Option 2: Improve my understanding of numpy, matplotlib, and pandas by revisiting datacamp videos and exercises:
#### Success Criteria
- [ ] I am working collaboratively with a debugging buddy to pair-assess the skills below as we work through exercises on datacamp.
- [ ] My debugging buddy and I are actively referring back to datacamp videos as we work through exercises on datacamp.
- [ ] I can import Data Science packages.
- [ ] I can generate and perform element-wise operations on numpy arrays.
- [ ] I can generate boolean numpy arrays based on given conditions.
- [ ] I can subset numpy arrays.
- [ ] I can use matplotlib to generate a variety of different data visualizations such as line plots, scatter plots, and histograms.
- [ ] I can use matplotlib to customize data visualizations.
- [ ] I can interpret data visualizations.
- [ ] I can use pandas to convert dictionaries and .csv files to dataframes.
- [ ] I can use pandas to subset and slice dataframes.
- [ ] I can use pandas to filter dataframes.


### Option 3: Show what I know by working on my Data Story Project:
#### Success Criteria
- [ ] I am working collaboratively with a debugging buddy to pair-assess our progress in relation to the benchmarks below as we work on our Data Story Projects.
- [ ] My debugging buddy and I are actively referring back to datacamp videos as we work on our Data Story Projects.
- [ ] I am regularly running, saving, adding, commiting, and pushing my work to GitHub, and writing appropriate commit messages.
- [ ] I have thoroughly described the dataset I selected, including why I selected it and a few specific questions that can be asked about it.
- [ ] I have selected one specific question about my dataset, made a prediction, generated a data visualization to test my prediction, and described any conclusion(s) that can be inferred from the data visualization I generated.
- [ ] I have expanded the story my data tells by generating several additional data visualizations, and describing any conclusion(s) that can be inferred from the new data visualizations I generated.
- [ ] I have applied customization to my data visualizations to make them more accessible to the general public.
- [ ] I have consolidated my work into a report that meets all requirements as outlined in part 4 of this project.
