# Data Science 1
## Data Story Project

**TASK:** Select a dataset and leverage what you have learned about the numpy, matplotlib, and pandas packages to tell its story through a set of data visualizations and verbal descriptions.

## Part 1: Select and Explore a Dataset

Navigate to https://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/spring2023/en-us/lessons/choosing-your-dataset/pages/datasets-and-starter-files.html and browse through the available datasets.  As you browse, open each dataset to explore the data itself.

* Identify one dataset that you find particularly interesting to explore in more depth.
* In a Jupyter Notebook file, use Markdown to write three short paragraphs that address the following prompts:
	* Describe the dataset you selected (e.g., In general, what data does it contain?, What do the rows represent?, What do the columns represent? What pattern(s) do you notice?, etc.)
  * Describe why you selected this specific dataset. (e.g., What piqued your interest?, In what ways does it relate to your future career?, Why does exploring this data matter?, etc.)
  * Describe a few specific questions that could be asked about this data. (e.g., Is there a specific pattern you noticed that you are curious about?, What other context is not included in the data set that you are curious about?, etc.)
* Run your file.
* Save your file as `LastNameFirstInitial_DataStoryProject.ipynb`, add, commit, and push it to your GitHub portfolio. (Remember to include an appropriate commit message.)

## Part 2: Generate your First Data Visualization

Revisit the dataset you selected for part 1 of this project.  

* Select one question that can be explored using a data visualization.
* In a new cell in your `LastNameFirstInitial_DataStoryProject.ipynb` file, using Markdown, use Markdown to address the following prompts:
	* What question did you select?
  * Make a prediction: What do you think the answer to your question will be and why?
* In a new cell, write some code to generate a data visualization that can be used to test your prediction.
* In a new cell, use Markdown to describe the conclusion(s) that can be inferred from the data visualization you generated.  Was your prediction confirmed?
* Run all cells in your file.
* Save, add, commit, and push your file to your GitHub portfolio. (Remember to include an appropriate commit message.)

## Part 3: Expand the Story your Data Tells

* In a new cell in your `LastNameFirstInitial_DataStoryProject.ipynb` file, write some code to generate several additional data visualizations to expand the story your data tells.
* Apply customization to each data visualization to make it more accessible to the general public.
* In a new cell, use Markdown to describe the conclusions that can be drawn from each data visualization.
* Run all cells in your file.
* Save, add, commit, and push your file to your GitHub portfolio. (Remember to include an appropriate commit message.)

 ## Part 4: Consolidate your Work into a Report

**CAUTION:** Before cutting any cells, be sure you have saved, added, committed, and pushed part 3 to your GitHub Portfolio! 

<ins>Structure your report as follows:</ins>

* **Top Cell:** Introduction -  Use Markdown to describe this project, the dataset you selected, the questions you sought to answer about the dataset you selected, and the predictions you made.<br><br>

* **Second Cell:** Code for Data Visualizations (and Data Visualizations) - Remember to customize all data visualizations to make them more accessible to the general public.<br><br>


* **Third Cell:** Data Story - Use Markdown to describe the story your data tells (i.e. what conclusions were you able to infer from the data visualizations you generated?)  Additionally, describe the recommendations you might make based on the conclusions you inferred?<br><br>

* **Fourth Cell:** Conclusion - Use Markdown to conclude by reflecting on your work:
	* In what ways did this project contribute to your overall learning experience as a Computer Science major?
  * How did you develop this project iteratively over time?
  * What might you have done differently?
  * If you were to extend your work on this project, what might your next steps be?<br><br>

**CAUTION:** Before completing the next steps, be sure you have saved, added, committed, and pushed your progress to your GitHub Portfolio! 

* Cut all other cells.
* Run all cells in your file.
* Save, add, commit, and push your file to your GitHub portfolio. (Remember to include an appropriate commit message.)

## Assessment Criteria

|Outcome|Mastery Looks Like...|
